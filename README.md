✨ Key Notes for Users

Points assigned to questions is optional and if not entered Canvas will default to 1 point per question.

True/False in CSV Format 2:
Use 1 for true, 0 for false in the correct_answer column.

You can link to local images within your source files using a simple tag format: \`img(image_filename.png)\`.

Example in a .txt file:

```
`q`
What is shown in the diagram below?
`img(mitochondria_diagram.jpg)`
`mc` `p5`
Cell Membrane
Nucleus
Mitochondrion
Ribosome
`a`
Mitochondrion
```
The script will automatically find mitochondria_diagram.jpg in the same folder as your source file, embed it correctly in the QTI, and bundle it into the final .zip package. This works for question stems and multiple-choice options.

The script is "LaTeX-aware." Text inside math delimiters (```$$...$$``` for block equations and ```\(...\)``` for inline equations) will be passed through to Canvas without being HTML-escaped. This ensures your mathematical formulas render correctly.


<br>
🗜️ When there is more than one correct answer

Fill-in-the-Blank can have multiple correct answers assigned:
For CSV: Put the answers directly in correct_answer column separated by pipes (|).
For JSON: Put the answers in brackets separated by commas in the line for "correct_answer": `["answer1", "answer2"...]`.
For TXT: Put the answers in the line under the `a` tag line and simply separate answers by a comma.


<br>
